# PygameProject
This is the final project I'm making for my Object Oriented Programming course at BCIT.

It is a game written in Python using pygame that should have some of the following functionality

* randomly generated levels with collidable walls (any collision results in failure)

* a high-score tracker system using JSON

* if this turns out to be Tron rather than snake: AI opponents to "fight" with a simple algorithm defining it's target and whether or not it attempts to avoid ribbons

## Snake vs Tron
Due to the massive similarities between how a snake functions and how a lightbike functions, the line is a thin one.

The only major difference is that a snake has a finite tail, and a lightbike has an infinite tail.

## Final Note as of Dec 4th 2022

Admittedly in the pursuit of a quick throwtogether that would work for a a final project submission, I have neglected to make any recent changes to the readme. That's my bad. Even this edit has occured after submission. Oh well I suppose
